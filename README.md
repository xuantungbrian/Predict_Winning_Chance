# Predict_Winning_Chance
The main idea of this repository is to predict the winning chance of a game called Arena of Valor, a MOBA 5vs5 game using Keras AI model. The idea is a game will be a sample and each sample will have 10 features, representing each player. To create more data, I will move member of a team around (for example feature 1 belongs to the first team and can be moved to feature 2, then feature 3 columns, and so on) However, the code did not work as expected: the validation error is too high, about 0.6. Honestly, I was expecting a lower result and I believe it is due to the poor dataset. Although I tried to move columns (which are features) around to create more data, the training data basically contains around 50 examples and the validation data contains 5 examples. Moreover, there are many other aspects leading to the winning possibility of a game so it's hard to predict.
